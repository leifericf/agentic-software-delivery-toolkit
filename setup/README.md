# Setup / Welcome Workflow

This workflow captures user preferences (how you like to work with an agent) into a local, re-runnable profile file.

- Run: `@setup/01_setup_wizard.md`
- Output: `.agentic_profile.md` (gitignored by default)

If you skip this, the rest of the toolkit still works; the agent will fall back to defaults.
