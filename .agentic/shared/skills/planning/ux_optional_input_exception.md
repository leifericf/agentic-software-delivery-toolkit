# Skill: UX optional input exception

Use when a workflow step lists `.agentic/artifacts/ux_design_guide.md` as an input, but the project legitimately has no user-facing interface.

## Rule
`.agentic/artifacts/ux_design_guide.md` may be missing only if a decision log row in `.agentic/artifacts/decision_log.md` documents that UX was intentionally skipped due to no user-facing interface.
