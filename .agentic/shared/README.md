# Shared Templates

General-purpose templates that can be reused across workflows (planning, implementation, and future workflows).

- `roles/` - reusable role definitions used by workflow steps
- `skills/` - reusable skill modules referenced by roles and steps

Standalone shared template:
- `log_decisions.md` - optional prompt to reconcile/lock decisions
