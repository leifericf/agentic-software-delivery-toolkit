# Setup / Welcome Workflow

Capture your local interaction preferences in a re-runnable profile file.

- Tag: `@.agentic/setup/01_setup_wizard.md`
- Output: `.agentic/.agentic_profile.md` (gitignored by default)

If you skip this, the rest of the toolkit still works; the agent will fall back to defaults.
