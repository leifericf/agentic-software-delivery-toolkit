# Decision Log Update (Shared)

If this step introduces or finalizes decisions:

- Append one or more rows to `artifacts/<project_slug>/04_decision_log.md` using the table format from `@planning/04_log_decisions.md`.
- Do not rewrite prior rows except to correct factual errors.
- If a decision changes, append a new row that references the earlier decision.
