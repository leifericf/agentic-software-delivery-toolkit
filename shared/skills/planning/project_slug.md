# Skill: Project slug

Use when a `project_slug` is needed and not yet known.

## Slug selection (mandatory)
1. Ask for a human-friendly project name.
2. Suggest 3-5 `project_slug` options and have the user choose.
3. Always include a custom option.
4. Validate the chosen/custom slug against the rules below.

## Slug rules (strict)
See `@shared/skills/planning/slug_rules.md`.
