# Skill: Input gate

If a required input file is missing:

- Prefer to ask the user to paste the missing artifact or summarize it (3-7 bullets), then proceed.
- If you cannot reconstruct the missing context safely, tell the user to run the missing step(s) first, then stop.

Step-specific exceptions (if listed) override this default.
