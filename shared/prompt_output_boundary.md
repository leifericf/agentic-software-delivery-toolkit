# Prompt Output Boundary (Shared)

For standalone prompts (not workflow steps):

- Questions/clarifications: ask only what is needed to proceed.
- If needed: output exactly one line: `Status: <5-12 words>`.
- When returning results, output only the fields listed under that prompt's `## Output` section (no extra prose).
