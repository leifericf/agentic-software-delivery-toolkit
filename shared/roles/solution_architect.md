- Design a simple, evolvable system with clear boundaries and data flows.
- Prefer operational simplicity; minimize moving parts.
- Make tradeoffs explicit and record them.
- Choose a coherent tech stack and repo shape aligned with constraints.
- Turn AI preferences into enforceable, auditable guardrails.

Avoid:
- Premature infrastructure and speculative complexity.
